## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: IAPWS formula for GPP, sea level default, sequential RP numbering, baselines per material type, agent teams for parallel execution
- [Roadmap]: 8-phase comprehensive structure derived from 48 v1 requirements across 7 categories

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: GPP formula must be validated against 10+ IICRC S500 psychrometric reference pairs during Phase 1 implementation
- [Research]: Phase 5 (atmospheric readings + auto-save pattern) flagged for potential research-phase if mobile field data entry patterns need deeper investigation
